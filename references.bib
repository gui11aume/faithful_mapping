	abstract = {The increasing throughput of DNA sequencing technologies creates a need for faster algorithms. The fate of most reads is to be mapped to a reference sequence, typically a genome. Modern mappers rely on heuristics to gain speed at a reasonable cost for accuracy. In the seeding heuristic, short matches between the reads and the genome are used to narrow the search to a set of candidate locations. Several seeding variants used in modern mappers show good empirical performance but they are difficult to calibrate or to optimize for lack of theoretical results. Here we develop a theory to estimate the probability that the correct location of a read is filtered out during seeding, resulting in mapping errors. We describe the properties of simple exact seeds, skip-seeds and MEM seeds (Maximal Exact Match seeds). The main innovation of this work is to use concepts from analytic combinatorics to represent reads as abstract sequences, and to specify their generative function to estimate the probabilities of interest. We provide several algorithms, which combined together give a workable solution for the problem of calibrating seeding heuristics for short reads. We also provide a C implementation of these algorithms in a library called Sesame. These results can improve current mapping algorithms and lay the foundation of a general strategy to tackle sequence alignment problems. The Sesame library is open source and available for download at https://github.com/gui11aume/sesame.},

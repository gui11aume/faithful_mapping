The basic algorithm is simple and robust; it can be implemented in a number of ways and applied in a variety of contexts including straightforward DNA and protein sequence database searches, motif searches, gene identification searches, and in the analysis of multiple regions of similarity in long DNA sequences. In addition to its flexibility and tractability to mathematical analysis, BLAST is an order of magnitude faster than existing sequence comparison tools of comparable sensitivity.},

    abstract = {A key issue in managing today's large amounts of genetic data is the availability of efficient, accurate, and selective techniques for detecting homologies (similarities) between newly discovered and already stored sequences. A common characteristic of today's most advanced algorithms, such as FASTA, BLAST, and BLAZE is the need to scan the contents of the entire database, in order to find one or more matches. This design decision results in either excessively long search times or, as is the case of BLAST, in a sharp trade-off between the achieved accuracy and the required amount of computation. The homology detection algorithm presented in this paper, on the other hand, is based on a probabilistic indexing framework. The algorithm requires minimal access to the database in order to determine matches. This minimal requirement is achieved by using the sequences of interest to generate a highly redundant number of very descriptive tuples; these tuples are subsequently used as indices in a table look-up paradigm. In addition to the description of the algorithm, theoretical and experimental results on the sensitivity and accuracy of the suggested approach are provided. The storage and computational requirements are described and the probability of correct matches and false alarms is derived. Sensitivity and accuracy are shown to be close to those of dynamic programming techniques. A prototype system has been implemented using the described ideas. It contains the full Swiss-Prot database rel 25 (10 MR) and the genome of E. Coli (2 MR). The system is currently being expanded to include the complete Genbank database.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)},

    abstract = {The development of high-throughput sequencing technologies has revolutionized the way we study genomes and gene regulation. In a single experiment, millions of reads are produced. To gain knowledge from these experiments the first thing to be done is finding the genomic origin of the reads, i.e., mapping the reads to a reference genome. In this new situation, conventional alignment tools are obsolete, as they cannot handle this huge amount of data in a reasonable amount of time. Thus, new mapping algorithms have been developed, which are fast at the expense of a small decrease in accuracy. In this chapter we discuss the current problems in short read mapping and show that mapping reads correctly is a nontrivial task. Through simple experiments with both real and synthetic data, we demonstrate that different mappers can give different results depending on the type of data, and that a considerable fraction of uniquely mapped reads is potentially mapped to an incorrect location. Furthermore, we provide simple statistical results on the expected number of random matches in a genome (E-value) and the probability of a random match as a function of read length. Finally, we show that quality scores contain valuable information for mapping and why mapping quality should be evaluated in a probabilistic manner. In the end, we discuss the potential of improving the performance of current methods by considering these quality scores in a probabilistic mapping program.},

Detailed analysis of the miscall pattern indicated that the underlying mechanism involves sequence-specific interference of the base elongation process during sequencing. The two major sequence patterns that trigger this sequence-specific error (SSE) are: (i) inverted repeats and (ii) GGC sequences. We speculate that these sequences favor dephasing by inhibiting single-base elongation, by: (i) folding single-stranded DNA and (ii) altering enzyme preference. This phenomenon is a major cause of sequence coverage variability and of the unfavorable bias observed for population-targeted methods such as RNA-seq and ChIP-seq. Moreover, SSE is a potential cause of false single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) calls and also significantly hinders de novo assembly. This article highlights the importance of recognizing SSE and its underlying mechanisms in the hope of enhancing the potential usefulness of the Illumina sequencers.},
